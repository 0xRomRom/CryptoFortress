Cloning the main repo & pushing new files to it.

1. Create a directory to pull the repo to (i.e. C:\Users\RS\Desktop\Crypto Fortress>)
2. Open your IDE, open ^ directory in IDE.
3. Open terminal in IDE, input: git clone https://github.com/0xRomRom/CryptoFortress.git
4. Repo will be cloned into the folder from step 1.
5. In the terminal, input: cd <name of step 1 folder>

Now working in the CF repo!

When committing make sure to be in the correct path (i.e. C:\Users\RS\Desktop\Crypto Fortress\CryptoFortress>), the one
we worked towards in step 5.

To commit: 

In the terminal:
1. git add .                         //(Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area)
2. git commit -m "message here"      //(Commits the files to the local repo)
3. git push                          //(Pushes the local repo into the live repo)
